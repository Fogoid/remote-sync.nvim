# remote-sync.nvim

This repository was created with the intent of helping myself in my
day-to-day work, where I require a remote machine to execute builds,
while still developing on my local machine.

To do so, I am developing this plugin, which should automate this workflow.
The following commands are planned to be available:

- SyncProject
- SyncNew

In a first stage, only SyncProject will be implemented
